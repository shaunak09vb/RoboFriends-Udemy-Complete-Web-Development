# RoboFriends-Udemy-Complete-Web-Development

This Repository is the First React Project that I developed as part of The Complete Web Developer in 2021: Zero to Mastery course. This project helped me gain hands on experience about React and all it's different components. Additionally, I was able to host my developed website on the internet using GitHub pages.
